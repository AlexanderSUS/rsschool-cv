Hello everyone!

My name is Alexander, and I want to be a frontend developer. 
I don't have any experience in frontend, but  thanks to my previous
job I allready have an experience of teamwork,
comunications with customers and partners, I belive it really helps me
in my future career.  As I didn't had any programming skills I statrted my path
 with studying of cumputer scince and C language. 
It's took a lot of time to be deep in it. Also I learn English. According Epam test my level is 
A1, but I can almost freely read  a documentation  and can speak in a fashion. 
During that time I learned to use the Linux terminal, I mastered of blind typing and Vim editor.
Now I'm studying HTML, CCS and JavaScript with RS Shool courses.
According thoose programm this coursces gives a good traning for future work.
And I hope to get a good skills.
